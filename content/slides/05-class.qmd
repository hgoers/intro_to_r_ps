2.  Create a script that you can use to explore new data sets in the future

## Quarto 

Quarto is a tool that helps you to create fully reproducible research outputs.

-   Allows combine your code, results, and prose in one document.

## Code chunks

```{{r}}
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)
```

## Chunk options

```{{yaml}}
execute:
  echo: true
  message: false
  warning: false
```

## In-line code

You include R code directly in your prose using the expression: `r`. For example:

Will render as: There are 234 observations in our data.

No need to go and update this reference if that number changes!
