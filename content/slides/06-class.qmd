## Learning objectives

1.  Learn how to combine your code, results, and prose in one document

2.  Be introduced to markdown

## Quarto

## Writing prose in Quarto

You will need to know some markdown!

## Running code in Quarto

Code chunks start with ```` ```{r} ```` and ends with ```` ``` ````:

```{{r}}
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)
```

## Code chunks

You can control how these code chunks render and are displayed using code chunks:

```{{r}}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
```

A full list of chunk options can be found here: https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html

## Code chunks

You can set default chunk options in the YAML:

```{{yaml}}
execute:
  echo: true
  message: false
  warning: false
```

## In-line code

You will often want to reference numbers or results in your prose:

<br>

You include R code directly in your prose using the expression: \`r\`. For example:

Renders:

*There are 234 observations in our data.*

*Reminder*

In the final session, you will apply the skills you will learn over the next few days to a problem that interests you. To prepare for this, you need to find a data set that:

1.  Is relevant to your research interests,

2.  Contains continuous and discrete variables.
